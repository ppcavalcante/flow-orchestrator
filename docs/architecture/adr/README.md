# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for Flow Orchestrator.

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences.

## ADR Files

ADRs are numbered sequentially and named using the format `NNNN-title-with-dashes.md` where:
- `NNNN` is a four-digit number that is incremented for each new ADR
- `title-with-dashes` is a short title for the ADR, with spaces replaced by dashes
