# Memory and Performance Optimization

This guide describes the memory management and concurrent data structures used in Flow Orchestrator, along with techniques to optimize workflow performance.

## Memory Management

Flow Orchestrator uses custom memory management components to optimize performance and reduce garbage collection pressure in high-throughput scenarios.

### Arena Memory Allocator

The Arena memory allocator provides efficient memory allocation with minimal overhead. It allocates memory in large blocks and then sub-allocates from these blocks, reducing the number of system allocations and garbage collection pressure.

    subgraph "System Heap"
        A1[Arena Block 1: 64KB]
        A2[Arena Block 2: 64KB]
        A3[Arena Block 3: 64KB]
    end
    
    subgraph "Arena Allocator"
        M["Arena Manager"]
    end
    
    M --> A1
    M --> A2
    M --> A3
    
    subgraph "Allocations in Block 1"
        A1 --> O1[String: 24 bytes]
        A1 --> O2[Map: 48 bytes]
        A1 --> O3[Struct: 32 bytes]
        A1 --> O4[Free Space]
    end
    
    subgraph "Allocations in Block 2"
        A2 --> O5[Large Object: 40KB]
        A2 --> O6[Free Space]
    end

    style A2 fill:#bbf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px

```

#### Key Features

- **Block-based allocation**: Allocates memory in large blocks to reduce system calls
- **Zero-allocation string operations**: Provides string utilities that avoid allocations
- **Fast reset**: Quickly frees all memory in an arena without individual deallocations
- **Thread safety**: Optionally provides thread-safe allocation operations
- **Memory pooling**: Reuses arena blocks to further reduce allocations

#### Usage

```go
// Create a new arena
arena := workflow.NewArena()

// Allocate memory
data := arena.Alloc(1024)

// Allocate and copy a string
str := arena.AllocString("example string")

// Reset the arena (free all allocations at once)
arena.Reset()

// Free the arena
arena.Free()
```

### String Pool

The String Pool provides string interning capabilities, allowing strings with the same content to share the same memory, reducing memory usage for repeated strings.

#### Key Features

- **String interning**: Stores only one copy of each unique string
- **Memory efficiency**: Reduces memory usage for repeated strings
- **Pre-interned common strings**: Common strings are pre-interned for efficiency
- **Thread-safe operations**: Safe for concurrent use

#### Usage

```go
// Create a new string pool with an arena
arena := NewArena()
pool := NewStringPool(arena)

// Intern a string
str1 := pool.Intern("example")
str2 := pool.Intern("example")

// str1 and str2 point to the same memory
```

### Buffer Pool

The Buffer Pool provides a pool of reusable byte buffers, reducing allocations for temporary buffers used in operations like serialization and network I/O.

#### Key Features

- **Size-based pooling**: Maintains separate pools for different buffer sizes
- **Automatic sizing**: Provides buffers of appropriate size for the requested capacity
- **Buffer reuse**: Reuses buffers to reduce allocations
- **Thread-safe operations**: Safe for concurrent use

#### Usage

```go
// Get a buffer from the pool
buf := GetBuffer(1024)

// Use the buffer
// ...

// Return the buffer to the pool
PutBuffer(buf)

// Or use the WithBuffer helper
err := WithBuffer(1024, func(buf *[]byte) error {
    // Use the buffer
    return nil
})
```

### Node Pool

The Node Pool provides a pool of reusable workflow nodes, reducing allocations when creating and executing workflows.

#### Key Features

- **Node reuse**: Reuses node objects to reduce allocations
- **Automatic cleaning**: Cleans nodes before returning them to the pool
- **Thread-safe operations**: Safe for concurrent use

#### Usage

```go
// Get a node from the pool
node := GetNode()

// Configure the node
node.Name = "example"
node.Action = someAction

// Use the node
// ...

// Return the node to the pool
PutNode(node)
```

## Concurrent Data Structures

Flow Orchestrator uses custom concurrent data structures to ensure thread safety and high performance in multi-threaded scenarios.

### Concurrent Map

The Concurrent Map provides a thread-safe map implementation with better performance characteristics than using a standard map with a mutex in high-concurrency scenarios.

#### Key Features

- **Thread-safe operations**: All operations are safe for concurrent use
- **Fine-grained locking**: Uses sharding to reduce lock contention
- **Full map operations**: Provides all standard map operations (get, set, delete, etc.)
- **Iteration support**: Supports iterating over all keys and values

#### Usage

```go
// Create a new concurrent map
cm := NewConcurrentMap()

// Set a value
cm.Set("key", "value")

// Get a value
value, exists := cm.Get("key")

// Delete a value
cm.Delete("key")

// Iterate over all items
cm.ForEach(func(key string, value interface{}) {
    // Process key and value
})
```

### Read Map (Lock-Free Map)

The Read Map provides a lock-free map implementation optimized for read-heavy workloads, using atomic operations to ensure thread safety without locks for read operations.

#### Key Features

- **Lock-free reads**: Read operations don't require locks
- **Atomic updates**: Updates are performed atomically
- **Copy-on-write semantics**: Updates create a new copy of the map
- **Thread-safe operations**: All operations are safe for concurrent use

## Performance Optimization Techniques

### 1. Use Appropriate Concurrency Settings

Configure the workflow engine with appropriate concurrency settings:

```go
options := workflow.WorkflowOptions{
    MaxConcurrency: runtime.NumCPU(), // Set based on available CPU cores
}

workflow := &workflow.Workflow{
    DAG:        dag,
    WorkflowID: "my-workflow",
    Store:      store,
    Options:    options,
}
```

### 2. Optimize Action Size

- **Right-size actions**: Actions shouldn't be too small (overhead) or too large (blocks parallelism)
- **Batch operations**: Group related small operations into a single action
- **Split large actions**: Break down large operations to improve parallelism

### 3. Use Memory Optimization Features

Enable memory optimization features for high-throughput scenarios:

```go
options := workflow.WorkflowOptions{
    EnableArenaAllocator: true,
    ArenaSize: 64 * 1024, // 64KB blocks
    EnableStringInterning: true,
    EnableBufferPooling: true,
    EnableNodePooling: true,
}
```

### 4. Minimize State Size

- Keep workflow data compact
- Use string interning for repeated strings
- Avoid storing large objects in workflow data
- Clean up temporary data when no longer needed

### 5. Optimize Persistence

- Use FlatBuffers store for high performance
- Batch persistence operations
- Configure appropriate persistence intervals
- Use compression for large workflow states

```go
// Create a FlatBuffers store with compression
store, err := workflow.NewFlatBuffersStore(
    "./workflow_data", 
    workflow.WithCompression(true),
)
```

### 6. Profile and Tune

Use Go's profiling tools to identify bottlenecks:

```bash
# CPU profiling
go test -bench=. -cpuprofile=cpu.prof

# Memory profiling
go test -bench=. -memprofile=mem.prof

# Block profiling (contention)
go test -bench=. -blockprofile=block.prof
```

### 7. Optimize DAG Structure

- Minimize dependencies between nodes
- Organize nodes to maximize parallelism
- Consider using composite actions for tightly coupled operations

## Benchmarking Your Workflows

Use the built-in benchmarking tools to measure performance:

```go
// Create a workflow benchmark
bench := workflow.NewBenchmark(dag)

// Run the benchmark
results := bench.Run(10) // Run 10 iterations

// Print results
fmt.Printf("Average execution time: %v\n", results.AvgExecutionTime)
fmt.Printf("Memory allocations: %d\n", results.Allocations)
fmt.Printf("Bytes allocated: %d\n", results.BytesAllocated)
```

## Conclusion

Flow Orchestrator provides several tools and techniques to optimize performance for high-throughput scenarios. By using the appropriate memory management features, concurrent data structures, and optimization techniques, you can achieve significant performance improvements for your workflows.
