```

**Analysis**:
- Arena-based string pool is the fastest method for string interning (~27% faster than individual interning)
- Batch interning is more efficient than individual interning for all methods
- Global interning is slightly faster than instance-based interning
- Batch operations show one allocation for the result slice, but this is amortized across all strings
- Arena string pool provides the best overall performance for string-heavy workloads

```

**Analysis**:
- Direct goroutine usage is significantly faster than limited concurrency for all workload sizes
- The performance gap widens with larger workloads (2.9x for light, 18.2x for medium, 54.2x for heavy)
- Memory allocation is similar between approaches, indicating the overhead is primarily in scheduling
- Limited concurrency shows better predictability but at a substantial performance cost
- For workflows with many lightweight tasks, direct goroutines are strongly preferred

#### Concurrency Scaling

```

**Analysis**:
- Performance scales almost linearly with the number of workers up to 32 workers
- Memory allocation remains constant regardless of worker count
- Doubling the worker count consistently halves the execution time
- No signs of diminishing returns up to 32 workers, indicating good parallelization
- The system effectively utilizes available CPU cores for parallel execution

### Workflow Data Performance

#### WorkflowData Set/Get Performance

```
BenchmarkWorkflowDataSetGet/Size_10-10         	 1901974	       790.6 ns/op	      48 B/op	       4 allocs/op

```

**Analysis**:
- Set/Get operations are very fast (under 1 microsecond)
- Performance is consistent across different workflow sizes
- Memory allocation is minimal and consistent (48-54 bytes, 4 allocations)
- Slightly better performance for medium and large workflows suggests potential caching benefits

## Performance Optimization Recommendations

Based on the benchmark results, the following optimization strategies are recommended:

### 1. DAG Construction Optimization

- Use linear or tree-like DAG topologies when possible
- Avoid highly interconnected random DAGs
- Pre-compute dependency relationships for complex workflows
- Consider breaking very large workflows into smaller sub-workflows

### 2. Memory Optimization

- Use arena allocation for medium-sized objects (256-1024 bytes)
- Employ string interning for workflows with many repeated strings
- Use buffer pooling for serialization and I/O operations
- Reset arenas instead of creating new ones for repeated operations

### 3. Concurrency Optimization

- Scale worker count based on available CPU cores
- Use direct goroutines for many lightweight tasks
- Use limited concurrency for resource-intensive operations
- Structure workflows to maximize parallel execution potential

### 4. Workflow Data Optimization

- Keep workflow data compact and focused
- Clean up temporary data when no longer needed
- Use appropriate data types (avoid interface{} when possible)
- Consider using ReadMap for read-heavy workflows

## Running Your Own Benchmarks

To benchmark your own workflows, use the built-in benchmarking tools:

```go
// Create a benchmark configuration
config := workflow.BenchmarkConfig{
    Iterations: 10,
    WarmupRuns: 2,
    TrackMemory: true,
}

// Create and run a benchmark
results := workflow.Benchmark(dag, config)

// Print results
fmt.Printf("Execution Time: %v (±%v)\n", results.AvgTime, results.StdDev)
fmt.Printf("Memory: %d bytes, %d allocations\n", results.AvgMemory, results.AvgAllocs)
```

For more detailed profiling, use Go's built-in profiling tools:

```bash
# Run benchmarks with CPU profiling
go test -bench=BenchmarkYourWorkflow -cpuprofile=cpu.prof

# Analyze with pprof
go tool pprof cpu.prof
```
